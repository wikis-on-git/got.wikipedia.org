==On Loanwords==
''(Transferred from [[Portal:𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌰𐌱𐍉𐌺𐍉𐍃/𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰]].)''

I’ve seen numerous things in the dictionary that could really be changed. My biggest problems with it are:
* Do we really need a made-up word for countries? “Peru” is, in the list, “Igkaland”. This is a big problem, though, because not only Incans live there, even before the Spanish came. Also, it’s kind of strange to be going and making up new names for countries when they already have names. “Peru” should be “Paíru”, as a neuter u-stem noun. Of course, places in Europe can have their own names, and maybe some elsewhere, but we don’t need to go crazy with calques. I see “Vatican City” is “Papagards”. Okay, it seems nice, but wouldn’t something like “Baúrgs Watikanus”. It would make much more sense. I can help come up with better names, if you agree that it should be this way.
* On a similar note, do we need to come up with new words for characters in things like Game of Thrones, The Hobbit, etc.? Those characters already have names that aren’t worth making new ones.
* I think Gothic would have, if it had lived all these years, taken in a ‘’lot’’ of loan words. Since it’s surrounded by Latin and Greek, it would have been full of words from those languages, and Arabic would have brought a lot of new words in, too. It wouldn’t have stayed linguistically pure at all. Mostly Germanic, of course, but still not completely Germanic.
I don’t want to sound rude, but I think Gothic wouldn’t have stayed so pure, and even going as far as to make up ridiculous names for faraway places shouldn’t be encouraged here. (I can imagine a group of Goths when they just hear that the Spanish have set up a place called "Perú": "You call it ''Perú'', you say? Then, we shall call it "Igkaland"! Now tell me, what kind of people live there, what’s it like, where is it?") --[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 21:10, 22 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:I actually agree with you. We should however stay with Thiudiskaland for Germany, as this is how the Germans called themselves in the time of the Goths. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 23:37, 22 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
::Well, like I said, locations in Europe should keep the names we're giving them, and all the other Germanic languages use "Thiudiskaland" anyway, so it works. I just needed to tell people that "Igkaland" is too obscure and ridiculous. Speaking of which, will there be a place where we put Gothic place names, kind of like an atlas? Or will this dictionary be the place for that? --[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 17:37, 23 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

:::Hello and thank you for using these discussion pages for the dictionary. To the topic:
:::I can somehow understand that you have mixed feeling on those new created words. But I have to say I do not share them at the same extent. I don't know who invented the word 'Igkaland', but maybe it comes from the name in Nahuatl for Peru which is 'Incatlan'. I doubt the '-lan' has anything to do with 'land, country'. I see that this is a case where a new word should be taken and I am totally fine when the 'community' (let's call this a community ;)) isn't fine with a certain word. Gothic language development isn't or shouldn't be a one-man project, consensus among several 'speakers' is always more useful. I would be glad for new ideas on names, you can either post them here or on the respective discussion page if there's an article on it. 
:::To the second thing: I am judging since quite a time on this Wikipedia that 'names stay names'! Names like Amy Winehouse shouldn't be reinterpreted to make them more Gothic. I haven't finished it yet but I am working on a guide on how write foreign , espacially English, names with Gothic script. I think we should proceed here as all the other languages with script that aren't Latin. So: What has a name keeps it. To write that name in Gothic script there should be two maxims: Write it as similar as possible, but also transcript it as similar to the original pronounciation as possible. There must be of course more rules, and I am on it and I have it finished we can discuss it. Examples are [[𐌻𐌴𐍉𐌽𐌰𐍂𐌳𐍉 𐌳𐌰 𐍅𐌹𐌽𐍄𐍃𐌾𐌹]], [[𐌼𐌹𐌺𐌴𐌻𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌶𐌾𐌴𐌻𐍉]] and [[𐍅𐌹𐌽𐍄𐍃𐌴𐌽𐍄 𐍆𐌰𐌽 𐌲𐍉𐍇]]. 
:::To the purism: Of course, if Gothic had stayed alive until now it would have undergone a lot more foreign influences. But not only would it have borrowed words it would also look totally different: [http://web.archive.org/web/20091018220118/http://geocities.com/erwan-ar-skoul/modgoth.html See here]. This is a approach to create a New Gothic, how it would like today if it had undergone natural language change. But concerning this matter it is hard to find a basis everybody can agree on because the revived Gothic language is a different one for everybody. It can either be the language spoken then, and only that. It can also be the language from then spoken coincidentally and suddenly today (like it travelled with a time machine) since some years to adopt and create new words from nowadays like mobile, fridge or microwave oven. (And even there are different movements: create new words on the basis of Gothic and with as much purism as possible to make words with the own lexicon and morphology resources, or allowing the process of foreign words incorporation or word borrowing). Another story is that Gothic survived throughout the whole time but didn't undergo structural language change but only adepted words from other languages in a natural way. That would be quite the scenario you are talking of. I myself think there is a way to reconcile all these. It is sure that nobody really wants the scenario with language change as seen in the link (only of course as a second New Gothic for it is fairly interesting). So it is just about borrowing and creating new words. And I guess the medio way is the best. It would be unnormal to keep the language clean of foreign influence. But on the other hand Gothic revival is a playground and a way to express creativity. So, by only adepting borrowed words the language revitalisation would be quite dull. I would always tend to be creative in the first instance, but when a word doesn't seem natural or too stilted I wouldn't dare to take a borrowed word that also correspond to the language's past, which means that a Chinese word would by pretty unlikely, Latin, Spanish, Greek or other Germanic languages would be very much more probable. And concerning the history I would say one should focus more on Spanish or older Spanish. Goths survived the fall of the West Gothic Empire, surely not as an ethnic group or language community until today, seen in some Gothic names of Spanish people. I guess they would have taken a lot of Spanish loanwords throughout the time. And of course Arabic as the Arabic Empire annexed Spain after the Goths failed.
:::Gothic place names should be first of all articles about that place. But feel free to create an article on special regions that summarise several names there and how they would be in Gothic. A Gothic atlas would of be great, but I guess we all are lacking time and ressources to do that. You can also bring words up for discussion in [[Portal:𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌰𐌱𐍉𐌺𐍉𐍃/𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰|here]]. 
:::(Okay, this text got longer as I firstly intended, sorry. But that's it from my side.) [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 14:46, 24 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
::::It seems highly unlikely that the Gothic word for "Peru" would be based on a word used by a native language of Mexico. The natives of Peru callit it "Piruw" or similar things, and so do all the languages of Europe, so there is no way "Incatlan" would find its way into Gothic. I really think Paíru is best here. About personal names, though, you're right, we have to transliterate them. I wasn't suggesting not doing that, as it's the only way. "Amy Wimehouse" would have to be "Eïmei Wáinháus", since this is the transliteration, and I'm okay with it. But, words like "fridge" or "cell phone", however, would get loanwords. It may not be creative, but it's certainly more plausible, and I think it would only make sense. I can't see how the Goths would immediately know that the German word for TV was "Fernsehen" and then calque that, so it's highly unlikely that that's what they'd do. They'd probably use a Spanish or English word, or even Italian for the Ostrogoths (and the two groups would eventually speak different dialects with influences from Spanish and Italian), so it would be, perhaps, "tēlēbisaúr" (tell me if I'm getting too slap-happy with the diacritics). Of course, there's always the possibility that they'd calque "televisor" anyway. The point is, it looks unnatural with this purism. Of course, we wouldn't randomly inject it with foreign words from all around the world, but some LAtin, Greek,  Spanish, Italian, and French would need to get in somehow. It's nothing to be afraid of, until it takes over, like with English. 
::::And, as for the atlas, what I meant is that we should have a place where we list the Gothic names of places. For example, we'd have the heading "Eitalja", and in bullet points below, it would say "Ruma", "Naiapoleis", etc....--[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 17:19, 24 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
