==On Loanwords==

I’ve seen numerous things in the dictionary that could really be changed. My biggest problems with it are:
* Do we really need a made-up word for countries? “Peru” is, in the list, “Igkaland”. This is a big problem, though, because not only Incans live there, even before the Spanish came. Also, it’s kind of strange to be going and making up new names for countries when they already have names. “Peru” should be “Paíru”, as a neuter u-stem noun. Of course, places in Europe can have their own names, and maybe some elsewhere, but we don’t need to go crazy with calques. I see “Vatican City” is “Papagards”. Okay, it seems nice, but wouldn’t something like “Baúrgs Watikanus”. It would make much more sense. I can help come up with better names, if you agree that it should be this way.
* On a similar note, do we need to come up with new words for characters in things like Game of Thrones, The Hobbit, etc.? Those characters already have names that aren’t worth making new ones.
* I think Gothic would have, if it had lived all these years, taken in a ‘’lot’’ of loan words. Since it’s surrounded by Latin and Greek, it would have been full of words from those languages, and Arabic would have brought a lot of new words in, too. It wouldn’t have stayed linguistically pure at all. Mostly Germanic, of course, but still not completely Germanic.
I don’t want to sound rude, but I think Gothic wouldn’t have stayed so pure, and even going as far as to make up ridiculous names for faraway places shouldn’t be encouraged here. (I can imagine a group of Goths when they just hear that the Spanish have set up a place called "Perú": "You call it ''Perú'', you say? Then, we shall call it "Igkaland"! Now tell me, what kind of people live there, what’s it like, where is it?") --[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 21:10, 22 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:I actually agree with you. We should however stay with Thiudiskaland for Germany, as this is how the Germans called themselves in the time of the Goths. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 23:37, 22 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
::Well, like I said, locations in Europe should keep the names we're giving them, and all the other Germanic languages use "Thiudiskaland" anyway, so it works. I just needed to tell people that "Igkaland" is too obscure and ridiculous. Speaking of which, will there be a place where we put Gothic place names, kind of like an atlas? Or will this dictionary be the place for that? --[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 17:37, 23 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
