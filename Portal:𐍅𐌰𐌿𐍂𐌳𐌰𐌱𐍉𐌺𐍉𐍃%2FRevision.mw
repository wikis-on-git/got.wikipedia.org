== 𐌰 ==
<pre>
af-muns, mi. - chance (What is it behind this word? What meaning of chance is meant here)
af-wigis, adv. (gen.) - incidentally; by the way (I would rather suggest the meaning of 'apart, off of the way' ger. 'abseits, vom Weg ab')
agati - magpie (Old High German 'agastra', but this can't be used for Gothic, '*ago' is only attested for Westgermanic. Something else has to be found)
agláiti, sn. (new sense) - pornographic (I would use the Greek word for it: paurnografus fu.)
áihti-láus, a. - proletarian (This word just means 'propertyless', whereas 'proletarian' means 'being in the work class/class of wage earners')
aíkaúnaúmi, fjo. - economy (Is the ending correct?)
áiqaírna, mn., áikwaírna, mn. - squirrel (What orthography should be used? And I would suggest:áikwohaúrn(il)a, similar to other Germanic languages)
Aírmana, mn. - Ermino - Grimm (Who/What is Ermino?)
aírþa-aléw, na., (Lat. ''petroleum'', G. ''Steiöl'') - petroleum (G. ''Erdöl'', Ic. ''jarðolía''); stáina-aléw, na. (I have the feeling that 'aléw' is a bad reconstruction since 'oil' comes from Latin 'oleum' or Ancient Greek 'élaion'.)
