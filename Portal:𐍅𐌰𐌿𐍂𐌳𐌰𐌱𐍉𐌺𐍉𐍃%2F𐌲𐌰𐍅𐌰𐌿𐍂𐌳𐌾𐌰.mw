==inmaidjei==
Why do give this as "change"? We already have a word for it "maidjan". The derrivation would be "maidjeins". This affects the other words derrived from that you posted. I'm going to change it. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==bokawaurda==
Why don't you just use the word "bokos" as it is traditional? [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==leinkan==
We already have a word for it used on this wikipedia and mentioned in the list: hlagks. And the verb to that is also used on this wikipedia: hlagkjan. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==bak-==
Why do you use "bak-" in the sense of "back"? This clearly derrived from English. The Gothic for it is: "afar" or in some contexts "hindar". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     Some of these are already on translatewiki, and need to be changed. Sorry. Also, for some reason<br/>
     translatewiki changes haven't updated on here yet, but I suppose that that's a good thing.

==maurgwaurdus==
First of all this would be "maurgu-" because maurgus is u-stem. And second, I don't agree with this form. There is no word like "waurdus" which is masculine, the real word is "waurd" or "waurdi". But both wouldn't fit quite well. In the sense of "text" one should better use "bokos". And the sense "short+text" wouldn't match the semantical sense of "summary". Without laying the focus on German I would recommend something equivalent to "Inhaltsangabe": "innahalda-angaba".

==weihta==
How do you come to the sense of "event"? What is the etymology behind this word? [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     I got niuja weihta from translatewiki, for it was already there.

==wreitmahteig==
Even if "wreit" seems to be cognate to the English word it wouldn't be a good word here. It has the meaning of carving and I don't think that a printer is still carving into the paper. The word for "write" is "meljan". But I like the ending "mahteigs", so I would say: meljamahteigs. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==seidogawiss==
What do you mean by navigation? The navigation on a website or the navigation with the device in the car? I think "gawiss" is not a good word for that. It means something like "juncture" or "ligament". I would say "wigatiuhands" which would be something like "way-leader" for "navigation device" and for navigation "wigatauhts".

==sundrawei==
What is the etymology behind this word?? [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     The etymology is from sundro, meaning privately.

==miþnatifodja==
I don't get why you use "miþ" but I don't agree with "fodja". This is very English and the Gothic word "fodja" is firstly wrong derrived from "fodjan" and second it really means the "feed" which is eaten by animals. The English expression cannot be so easily translated. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     What about strau instead?

==leista==
According to the most grammaticarians "ei" was pronounced "î". But the use of "ei" has etymological reasons. "lista" is a loanword and would not get an "ei" for long "î". It would just be "lista". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==faurthisskuggwa==
We already have a word for "preview" which is at the bottom of every "edit page": faursaihva. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     Sorry, fauthisskuggwa should be something more like "preview mode", because skuggwa means mirror or looking-glass.
     Really the only reason I added it here was because the word preview itself wasn't here yet.

Where shall "bus" come from? oO [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     Bus is from the word base, but I changed the ending so it would be a gothic noun ending.

==anaukanan==
The verb is "aukan" or "auknan". The dictionary gives "anaukan", "biaukan". And since this is not a new constructed word I'm going to delete it to keep the list clean. The list is only for new words. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
