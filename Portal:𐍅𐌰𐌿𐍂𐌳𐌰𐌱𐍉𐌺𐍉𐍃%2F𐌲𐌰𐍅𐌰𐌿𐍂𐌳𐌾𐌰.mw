:Yeah, that's the big problem. Translatewiki closed the translation function for the Gothic Wikipedia.

==maurgwaurdus==
First of all this would be "maurgu-" because maurgus is u-stem. And second, I don't agree with this form. There is no word like "waurdus" which is masculine, the real word is "waurd" or "waurdi". But both wouldn't fit quite well. In the sense of "text" one should better use "bokos". And the sense "short+text" wouldn't match the semantical sense of "summary". Without laying the focus on German I would recommend something equivalent to "Inhaltsangabe": "innahalda-angaba".

==wreitmahteig==
Even if "wreit" seems to be cognate to the English word it wouldn't be a good word here. It has the meaning of carving and I don't think that a printer is still carving into the paper.

What do you mean by navigation? The navigation on a website or the navigation with the device in the car? I think "gawiss" is not a good word for that.

:And how do you come to "-w-ei"?? That ending is only traditional to one word "agg-w-ei". And even there the "-w-" doesn't even belong to the ending itself.

:With feil you are right. I don't like it either. But bandwjan doesn't mean exactly to reveal an information as we need it, it means rather "to give a hint" "to reveal a sign/mystical". What about dividing it into two senses: feil (or another better word) for computer files as what it means and for other things we could use "wairth" what data would mean in that context.

:Why do you eliminate the fricative /h/? I think it should stay in that word since it was in the arabic word and the Goths could have only copied the word in earlier times and then there still was that fricative. Furthermore can't it be a "-i" declension as for that the criterias are: long vowel/diphthongue, short vowel + 2 consonants or more than one syllable. This is not true for this word. So the "-i" declension can't be applied here. I would still say it is just "kahwa". The arabic word had an "-a" at the end and was female, why should the Goths change this when it fits so perfectly to their declension? Mostly those cases are preserved from the original.

:Please always search the niuja waurda list first before you post new words.
:We already have words for computer - garahnja, keyboard - bokabaurd, paper - papeirus. 
:The word "abaka" wouldn't have existed. It never was female, in no language. 
:[[File:agree.png|15px|link]] It would be "abakus" and masculine. I would say it's ''abakus, m. (u-decl.)''.
:For "paper clip" I wouldn't use "-binda" since this would mean something like a "string" which is wraped around a paper. 
:Besides, I don't know why you divide between "staple" and "paper clip". 
:[[File:agree.png|15px|link]] For both "papeirukrampa, weak m." would fit.

chocolate - kokolats

:[[File:agree.png|15px|link]]I would rather say: sjaukaulada. Since chocolate is mostly female in gender languages and the [ʃ] sound is most common in this word. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 17:18, 15 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

brownie - sjaukauladokoks, st. f. (changing the ending of the work for cake because it's not a chocolate cake, but it's like one) [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 19:12, 15 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:Etymological it would be: [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]sjaukauladakaka, st. f. - and would just mean chocolate cake. For brownie there should be found another word. I would say that an english word wouldn't be wrong here: [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]"brauni, n. ja-decl." The word would fit into the ja-declension of a neuter noun.

waurdamuza (wk. masc. equivalent to declesion for man) for poet, (waurda + muza (from Gk. Μοῦσα))
[[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 03:53, 19 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

[[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 03:55, 19 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:Well, since "skald" (poet) seems to be pretty common to germanic languages and it is attested for Old Norse I would say it's [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]"skald, str. n." in Gothic. 
:For poetry I am not sure yet what to take. There must have been an own word for it. I guess it was something like "liuþ" even if it means the same as "song". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 19:06, 19 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

it could be liuthskap or something like that (song + ship = songship)

::Please always subscribe with <pre>~~~~</pre>. I don't think that the ending was that productive then and it wouldn't have the meaning to make a compound with "liuþ". I was thinking of something like "song art" as in Icelandic: "ljóðlist". But Gothic has no word for "art" attested. Any ideas? [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 10:19, 21 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

It could be handugei or something similar meaning "craft"/"trade"/"skill". [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 17:33, 21 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

== Niche ==
The word location/place/niche (as opposed to a physical location) could be niks.
[[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 14:32, 26 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:Niche is from French. So we wouldn't use it here. It derrives from the latin word for "nest". So in this case we should just use the Gothic word for nest which is [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]"sitls". I'll add it to the list. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 15:55, 12 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

== Tangle/knot ==

hnopjan, wv. I, meaning to tangle and knot, st. n., meaning knot (most Germanic language use kn- instead of the Icelandic hn-, and knut already refers to knee/kneeling).
[[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 14:17, 29 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:Knot would be: [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]hnots, str. m.; the verb to know would be: [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]hnotjan, -jan. I'm adding it to the list. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 15:52, 12 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==Category==

We need a word for category. [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 22:20, 16 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

kategori, st. f. ? [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 22:22, 16 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:First, it's true, that we need a word. Second, kategori would really not be the best choice then. 3. We have the problem, that the translation function for our wikipedia is closed. So we cannot change the word in the programming language. Maybe we could take "galisei" "collection" or "gatassei" "ordered things". [[Special:Contributions/92.224.85.242|92.224.85.242]] 21:47, 17 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:::The Icelandic word is "flokk", which also translates as group. All the other Germanic languages seem to just use a version of the word category. [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 17:30, 19 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
::::I just remembered! I've been using [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]hansa for category on Wt/got/ (gothic wiktionary). So that would be great cuz it means group. [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 20:16, 20 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

I thought of "natistaþs, st. m."?! [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 23:10, 27 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

I think that "nati" should mean just network, while we can make the equivalent of "world network", the internet, and "world network site/place" a website. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bleakgh|talk]]) 00:19, 29 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:"nati" is already the word for internet, you can look it up in the list of the gothic mailing list. (By the way it is not fatal that it has just the meaning of "net". In Germany we often say just say "Netz", too.) And as an equivalent to "web+site" we have "internet+place" = "natistaþs".

== Sentence ==
Do you have any ideas to form that? I am thinking of an old greek oriented form like: praso, w. f. or prasei, w. f. The last ending is often used for abstract nouns. I would prefer the last one. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 20:49, 30 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

I cannot think of a good word. But maybe it should base on the word for sentence if we find one. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 20:49, 30 𐌰𐌺𐍂𐌰𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

== modern ==
What would you use for it? I think "maudern" would be too easy. There must be a creative way to say that. Maybe somethings like: "himma dagis" or "nuwairþs". [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 21:11, 8 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

== painting ==
In the sense of German "Malerei", the art of painting, or the abstract thing. I would say: "frisahtandsei". [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 21:17, 8 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

== sculptor ==
What would you say for it? Maybe "gadigands"? Or according to the German word "Bildhauer", which is pretty pictographic, "frisahtaslahands"? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 21:43, 8 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

== anatomy/anatomist ==
I cannot decide whether we should assume a latin lownword "anataumia" or a gothic made up word: "leikkunþi" for "anatomy". A anatomist would then be "anataumists" or "leikkunþjands". What would you prefer? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 21:51, 8 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

When I need to write the word culture in Gothic, I just use the same word for society, that is what culture basically is. Though there is a slight difference in meaning, but I can't find newly invented words. What is the oldest Germanic word for culture? It might be best to use that [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 00:43, 24 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

== verschiedentlich (on various occasions) ==
In German there is this word "verschiedentlich" which means something like "in different ways". In Gothic there is a word called: "analeiko" which means "in the same way". We could then make a word up that means the difference: "anamisso". What do you think? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 20:14, 10 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

== position ==
I'm orientating on the german word "Stellung". "stellen" means "satjan" and "Stellung" or "position" would be "sateins, str. f. (-i)". [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 20:48, 10 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

A better Gothic translation of ''German Shephard'' is ''Þiudiskisks Skepa-haírdeis-hunds''. (''sa Þiudiskiska Skepa-haírdeis-hunds'' means ''the German Shephard''.)

I don't know if this has an impact to the correctness of the derivation of the Gothic word, but the German word "her" has two meanings: "ago" and "to here"; and in the word "herunterladen" it is used in the second meaning: "her-unter-laden" means "load down to-here".

== Some new word proposals ==

Ok, as I can't edit this page and I need to translate a website in Gothic, I will do some word proposals here for words which I simply can't find here but which need a word in Gothic. I will edit this part if I find new words, I just want to hear if there are better proposals here. If there aren't, I will simply use these words.

translation - in-meideins (this simply is the word 'change' in Gothic, which is a literal translation of 'translation')
button - hriggs (this is the word 'ring' in Gothic, if an old Goth would have lived in these days and saw a button on a computer screen, I think the most likely word he would use was 'circle', so maybe hriggs isn't such a bad word for a button, as we don't know what button was in Gothic.)
philosophy - þagki (the noun of the verb 'waurdjan' (to talk) is 'waurdi' (talking), the verb of to think is 'þagkjan' and however we can do the same with the word economy and have a direct borrowing, I think it's better if we, just like in Icelandic, try to create original words when it's possible.)
policy - runa (which is the word 'plan' in Gothic, as in 'Gods plan'. A policy is something which the gouvernment or an organization wants to happen, just like Gods intentions to let certain things happen, so the word 'runa' might be the most appropriate word here. The word is used here: 
"the teachers of the law rejected God's plan for them" witodafasteis fraqethun runa gudis ana sik.
