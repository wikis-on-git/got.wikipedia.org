:Yeah, that's the big problem. Translatewiki closed the translation function for the Gothic Wikipedia.

==maurgwaurdus==
First of all this would be "maurgu-" because maurgus is u-stem. And second, I don't agree with this form. There is no word like "waurdus" which is masculine, the real word is "waurd" or "waurdi". But both wouldn't fit quite well. In the sense of "text" one should better use "bokos". And the sense "short+text" wouldn't match the semantical sense of "summary". Without laying the focus on German I would recommend something equivalent to "Inhaltsangabe": "innahalda-angaba".

==wreitmahteig==
Even if "wreit" seems to be cognate to the English word it wouldn't be a good word here. It has the meaning of carving and I don't think that a printer is still carving into the paper.

What do you mean by navigation? The navigation on a website or the navigation with the device in the car? I think "gawiss" is not a good word for that.

:And how do you come to "-w-ei"?? That ending is only traditional to one word "agg-w-ei". And even there the "-w-" doesn't even belong to the ending itself.

:With feil you are right. I don't like it either. But bandwjan doesn't mean exactly to reveal an information as we need it, it means rather "to give a hint" "to reveal a sign/mystical". What about dividing it into two senses: feil (or another better word) for computer files as what it means and for other things we could use "wairth" what data would mean in that context.

:Why do you eliminate the fricative /h/? I think it should stay in that word since it was in the arabic word and the Goths could have only copied the word in earlier times and then there still was that fricative. Furthermore can't it be a "-i" declension as for that the criterias are: long vowel/diphthongue, short vowel + 2 consonants or more than one syllable. This is not true for this word. So the "-i" declension can't be applied here. I would still say it is just "kahwa". The arabic word had an "-a" at the end and was female, why should the Goths change this when it fits so perfectly to their declension? Mostly those cases are preserved from the original.

I don't know if this has an impact to the correctness of the derivation of the Gothic word, but the German word "her" has two meanings: "ago" and "to here"; and in the word "herunterladen" it is used in the second meaning: "her-unter-laden" means "load down to-here".

== Some new word proposals ==

Ok, as I can't edit this page and I need to translate a website in Gothic, I will do some word proposals here for words which I simply can't find here but which need a word in Gothic. I will edit this part if I find new words, I just want to hear if there are better proposals here. If there aren't, I will simply use these words. I will also explain why I use all these words.

*translation - in-meideins (this simply is the word 'change' in Gothic, which is some kind of translation of 'translation') The etymological origin of Latin however is:  "a carrying across, removal, transporting; transfer of meaning,"
:::There is already a word for 'to translate': 'gaskeirjan'. We can tighten the meaning to the extension of 'to translate'. 
::::I wrote this when I wasn't that good in Gothic yet. I always use 'skeirjan' for 'to translate' because the dictionaries give that meaning.

So if you prefer another word, I can fully agree on this, as I have the feeling that in-meideins isn't the best translation.
*button - hriggs (this is the word 'ring' in Gothic, if an old Goth would have lived in these days and saw a button on a computer screen, I think the most likely word he would use was 'circle', so maybe hriggs isn't such a bad word for a button, as we don't know what button was in Gothic.)
:::I guess I would go with the other languages that almost always use the allegory to the look of a 'button/knob'. So I'd suggest 'knuppa' mn.

::::::The problem is that knuppa is not attested, while hrigga is in fact attested, aren't we safer to use a word which the Goths definitely knew instead of a word which is a reconstruction while you have an alternative?

*philosophy - þagki (the noun of the verb 'waurdjan' (to talk) is 'waurdi' (talking), the verb of to think is 'þagkjan' and however we can do the same with the word economy and have a direct borrowing, I think it's better if we, just like in Icelandic, try to create original words when it's possible.)
:::If you'd derive 'philosophy' from 'þagkjan' I'd suggest something like 'þagkeins' fu. But even that would cover the meaning of 'philosophy'. I would go with the Greek word here: 'filosofia' fa. (Philosophy is the 'science of thinking' or 'the thinking about thinking'. To name it only 'thinking' would cover the meaning.) I would do the same with 'aikonomja' fa.

*policy - runa (which is the word 'plan' in Gothic, as in 'Gods plan'. A policy is something which the gouvernment or an organization wants to happen, just like Gods intentions to let certain things happen, so the word 'runa' might be the most appropriate word here. The word is used here: 
"the teachers of the law rejected God's plan for them" witodafasteis fraqethun runa gudis ana sik.
:::Don't you think that 'runa' is far too unspecialised for that meaning? It doesn't cover the meaning of 'policy' or describes it any further. It must be a word that really denotes what it means. As it is borrowed from Latin/Greek in almost every language I would go with 'politeia' fa. 

*gender - kuni (same word as family, in German we use Geschlecht and in Dutch geslacht, which etymological origin can be found here, my source is the etymological dictionary:

c.1300, "kind, sort, class," from Old French gendre (12c., Modern French genre), from stem of Latin genus (genitive generis) "race, stock, family; kind, rank, order; species," also (male or female) "sex" (see genus) and used to translate Aristotle's Greek grammatical term genos. 

So, the same word as family seems legit to me.
:::'kuni' has rather the meaning of 'tribe' or 'race'. I would go with Germanic cognates for which 'kunja' mn. was reconstructed. 

*administrator - ragineis (We have a lot of choice here, ragineis might be the best word as it means both a ruler and a councellor, a councellor was someone who ruled a city. Ruling a city means also maintaining policies and such and not just ruling without having obligations)
:::I would rather use a word that comes from 'andbahti' for that has the meaning of 'administration'. So, maybe 'andbahts' ma.

I have translated 'unregister' as:

Based on the verb 'to register' which is:

ana-meljan, as 'ana' is a preposition which means 'in' here, I thought that it would be logical to take the verb 'out', which is 'us', for unregister.

Compare it to Dutch: uitschrijven, this word is used as a negation of 'inschrijven', inschrijven means 'to register' and 'uitschrijven' mean to unregister, so it's used if you don't want to be a part of a municipality anymore.

==To click==

I recommend the following neologism and old Gothic word: kramjan
kramjan means 'to press' in Gothic, and not 'to press on a person', for which you also find a lot of translations.
My other neologism is 'klikjan'. As Dutch, English and German have equivalents of this word too. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 21:31, 4 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:I would go for 'kramjan', for 'click' is onomatopoeic for the sound of 'clicking'. In German and Dutch is more an anglicism than a cognate. But on the other hand I am not quite sure about its semantics. The only translation says 'to press', right. But I guess it is rather meant as 'to seize', 'to scratch' or 'to cram' (same word btw). I guess I said somewhere once something about '𐌸𐍂𐌹𐌿𐌺𐌾𐌰𐌽', as reconstructed from ger. 'drücken' or nl. 'drukken'. But I am not quite sure whether that is also the best choice.

I recommend something like, and correct me as I don't know how to combine words:  midjis-austra. Midja-austra. I don't know how to write it. fauraasia looks rather strange to me and I don't know this in any other Germanic language, it isn't used in Dutch, not in English, not in Scandinavian languages, only in German so why would you use it in Gothic then if it is not a shared word in all Germanic languages?

:::I didn't say they borrowed it from German. I just used it as an example because 'faura-' is quite productive in Gothic. Gothic doesn't always have to take the quintessence from all Germanic languages and only those forms that are attested in most Germanic languages. But as I said, something with 'middle' is fine with me. The problem is just that in every language the borders between the different Asia regions are quite different and not distinct. So we have to take the same blurry definitions like in English or elsewhere.
:::But maybe we could find a totally different form for Near and Middle East since the Crimgoths lived there.

::::If that's the case we don't know it anymore. I think that it's best if we choose the Middle East in Gothic, because what we are doing here is designing a modern Gothic. It needs to be an accessible language and if we make up new words which are completely different from other languages, you rather discourage people from learning modern Gothic than motivating them. I got to idea to maybe create a website to learn Gothic in the future, but I will wait until we have some standard forms for words etc. I discourage 'fauraasia' because not only Germanic but also Romanic languages use an equivalent of middle east, like French "le moyen-orient", therefore a rendering of middle east would not only be accessible for a lot of people, but simply also the most likely. I have another question, could you change Peru in just the word we already designed, I believe it was Pairu, now it says Igkaland and no one uses it or wants to use it, so that makes it a useless word.

::::::Well, we can get rid of aipistaule, but "sanda" is already used in so many places in my translations that it will be a hell to remove it all again. And is it really useful to remove it as 'sanda' basically gives the meaning of a sent message between two persons. But as for facebook messages etc. I agree with you that 'mereins' is a good word, as 'merjan' originally ment something like: to spread a message, to announce. And that is basically what you do. If we use mereins for personal messages too it can get confusing as you aren't spreading a message among a lot of people, but just with one person.

'sanda' doesn't fit the semantics here, it rather means something like 'shipment', a package is sent somewhere (not message).

:I recommend to not do that. German word uses are often restricted to German and the worst you can do. Try to find universal Germanic uses of words, that's why I always do. Or try to have a direct rendering of Latin. Could you add  international = miththiudisks  to your dictionary? I use this as it's a direct rendering of   'international' = inter (between) national (nations), miththiudisks basically has the same meaning.

I use it at my news website etc. so I recommend to insert it, as if you don't insert it, we will have different word uses in different places.

The neologism for phone is:  faírrahausjands  / faírrarodjands

mobile in the sense of mobile phone, could be based on the Gothic root for to move, movable.

Wigeinisks faírrahausjands  =   movable far-hearing.

:::It is surely not the worst thing to do to take a look at how German works. Icelandic and German morphology are one of the most complex withing the Germanic languages and still show the most traces of Old Germanic morphology. 
:::Even English has 'handy' for German 'handlich'. By 'mobile' I not only meant that a phone can be mobile, I meant morely the extension of 'handy'. For the meaning of mobile in 'phones' we could maybe derive something from 'bairan' for 'to carry'. I guess that covers the meaning of 'mobile' better than 'to walk'.

== term / condition ==
I would suggest: 'bilageins', st. f. from 'bilagjan'. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 14:01, 14 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:I came up with a word for term when I was translating Polyglotclub, I will look it up for you later. It looked like bilageins I think. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 01:55, 19 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

== institute ==
In the sense of research I would suggest: hruskastaþs, mi. 'place of research* [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 23:06, 18 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:Possible. But as the word institute is used in all Germanic languages I recommend a Gothic phonological adaption to this word. einsteitut? We could of course also offer a Gothic neologism and the word itself, institute in the Gothic way. 
:Sokastaþs might be possible too, but sokjan maybe has a bit of a different meaning. I think your hruskastaþs is better. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 02:06, 19 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
::I would be also in favour of both words. In German you could also possibly say: Forschungsstätte. But that's hardly used. I would use a Latinised word 'einstitut' na. Only the first /i/ was long in Latin, I suggest, Goths would orientate on that. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 09:24, 19 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

==to upload, a problem here==

I looked at the dictionary and I found, to upload:

'ushlaþan', may I ask what it is based on? This looks more like removing your download to me, because of us-. Uploading means something like putting it on the web, so I wondered if a literal translation like 'iupalaþan' would be good or maybe 'analaþan'.

==grammar==

Someone lecturing Gothic came up with the following neologism: maþlakunþi. I also sometimes use 'gramatika' as the loanword-alternative. I have used maþlakunþi quite a lot, is it also a good neologism for grammar? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 22:23, 20 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

::For spruce I derived from English spruce, coming up with "spráiws", does that work? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Moonspell Bloodlines|Moonspell the Goth (Mēnasáiþjis Gutan)]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Moonspell Bloodlines|talk]]) 00:08, 23 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

==gadfly==
For the word gadfly, can we use "brimusei"? I got the word from my friend Anulaibaz Gautafriþuz on his Proto-Germanic literature page on Facebook, he was talking about a gadfly, in his case a *bremusī, which he called it a "Cool nice beautiful word."
