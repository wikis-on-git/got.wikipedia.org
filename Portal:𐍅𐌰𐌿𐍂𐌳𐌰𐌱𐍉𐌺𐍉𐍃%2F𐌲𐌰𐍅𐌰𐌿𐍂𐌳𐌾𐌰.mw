==inmaidjei==
Why do give this as "change"? We already have a word for it "maidjan". The derrivation would be "maidjeins". This affects the other words derrived from that you posted. I'm going to change it. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==bokawaurda==
Why don't you just use the word "bokos" as it is traditional? [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     I suppose it could work, but the word book and the word text have different meanings as we use them.<br/>
     I meant text as in "search the full text of this article", which is translated in almost all languages as<br/>
     a loan of "text". - [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 15:24, 27 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:I know what you mean. But in the Gothic language there was no distinction between the two words "book" and "text". We have to accept that, languages can differ in semantics and lexics. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 12:46, 28 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==leinkan==
We already have a word for it used on this wikipedia and mentioned in the list: hlagks. And the verb to that is also used on this wikipedia: hlagkjan. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==bak-==
Why do you use "bak-" in the sense of "back"? This clearly derrived from English. The Gothic for it is: "afar" or in some contexts "hindar". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     Some of these are already on translatewiki, and need to be changed. Sorry. Also, for some reason<br/>
     translatewiki changes haven't updated on here yet, but I suppose that that's a good thing.
     [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 15:20, 27 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
:Yeah, that's the big problem. Translatewiki closed the translation function for the Gothic Wikipedia. They said that we have to write in Gothic letters but the users translating the wikipedia back then used latin letters. I really prefer Gothic letters as this is traditional. But they don't want to open the function again. If you can effect the opening of that function I'd be pretty happy.

==maurgwaurdus==
First of all this would be "maurgu-" because maurgus is u-stem. And second, I don't agree with this form. There is no word like "waurdus" which is masculine, the real word is "waurd" or "waurdi". But both wouldn't fit quite well. In the sense of "text" one should better use "bokos". And the sense "short+text" wouldn't match the semantical sense of "summary". Without laying the focus on German I would recommend something equivalent to "Inhaltsangabe": "innahalda-angaba".

     I got niuja weihta from translatewiki, for it was already there.
     [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 15:17, 27 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
:Ah okay. I just wanted to know since I couldn't find it. But I know its etymology but had no Gothic source. But it seems pretty proven that this words also existed in Gothic as it is quite typical for West- and Northerngermanic languages. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 12:51, 28 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==wreitmahteig==
Even if "wreit" seems to be cognate to the English word it wouldn't be a good word here. It has the meaning of carving and I don't think that a printer is still carving into the paper. The word for "write" is "meljan". But I like the ending "mahteigs", so I would say: meljamahteigs. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==seidogawiss==
What do you mean by navigation? The navigation on a website or the navigation with the device in the car? I think "gawiss" is not a good word for that. It means something like "juncture" or "ligament". I would say "wigatiuhands" which would be something like "way-leader" for "navigation device" and for navigation "wigatauhts".

==sundrawei==
What is the etymology behind this word?? [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     The etymology is from sundro, meaning privately.
     [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 15:16, 27 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
:And how do you come to "-w-ei"?? That ending is only traditional to one word "agg-w-ei". And even there the "-w-" doesn't even belong to the ending itself. And "sundrô" would stay the same when it is used in a compositum or derrivation: "sundro-...". I guess we should find a better ending here.

==miþnatifodja==
I don't get why you use "miþ" but I don't agree with "fodja". This is very English and the Gothic word "fodja" is firstly wrong derrived from "fodjan" and second it really means the "feed" which is eaten by animals. The English expression cannot be so easily translated. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==leista==
According to the most grammaticarians "ei" was pronounced "î". But the use of "ei" has etymological reasons. "lista" is a loanword and would not get an "ei" for long "î". It would just be "lista". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==faurthisskuggwa==

     Sorry, fauthisskuggwa should be something more like "preview mode", because skuggwa means mirror or looking-glass.
     Really the only reason I added it here was because the word preview itself wasn't here yet.
     [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 15:13, 27 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
:Hmm, some wikipedian words seems not to be on this niuja waurda page. But I still don't get the real sense of preview mode which might be a cause of being no mother speaker. Do you mean something like a modus? The prefix would by the way be "faur" or "faura" but not "faurþis". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 15:23, 28 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     Bus is from the word base, but I changed the ending so it would be a gothic noun ending.

:No, I really wouldn't say we should use an aglizism here. We can built that word with Gothic words. I would say it could be: feilbairgo. We already have a word for file which is "feíla". I actually do not agree with this anglizism. But I don't know a better word for it for so far. The word would then mean "file keeping". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 15:23, 28 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     I wouldn't use feila, since files and data are different. bandwjan means reveal information, which is close to datum/data.

:With feil you are right. I don't like it either. But bandwjan doesn't mean exactly to reveal an information as we need it, it means rather "to give a hint" "to reveal a sign/mystical". What about dividing it into two senses: feil (or another better word) for computer files as what it means and for other things we could use "wairth" what data would mean in that context. "wairthbairgo" would then be a collection of data in the sense of values. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 17:35, 30 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==anaukanan==
The verb is "aukan" or "auknan". The dictionary gives "anaukan", "biaukan". And since this is not a new constructed word I'm going to delete it to keep the list clean. The list is only for new words. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:This is because the list it stands in is from the gothic mailing list as you can see in the title. They don't have anything to do with the wikipedia. They created words aswell and such creation may differ. This is a problem. But I would prefer the word the wikipedia article has: [[Naurwigs]].

== Coffee ==

Since kafes is an irregular verb, could you please add it (in gothic script) and its declension to the English Wiktionary? Thanks.
:What do you mean by irregular verb? Don't you mean noun? And why is it irregular? And why don't you add it? ;) The only people here reading this are you and me. Haha [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 18:53, 28 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     kafes was already there as an irregular noun meaning coffee.

:There is no source for the Gothic word "kafes". If that word existed and they knew of "coffee" I would rather say it was something like "kahwa, w., f.". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 14:06, 29 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     It could be 'coffee - kafi, st. f.' [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 23:29, 29 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:Why do you eliminate the fricative /h/? I think it should stay in that word since it was in the arabic word and the Goths could have only copied the word in earlier times and then there still was that fricative. Furthermore can't it be a "-i" declension as for that the criterias are: long vowel/diphthongue, short vowel + 2 consonants or more than one syllable. This is not true for this word. So the "-i" declension can't be applied here. I would still say it is just "kahwa". The arabic word had an "-a" at the end and was female, why should the Goths change this when it fits so perfectly to their declension? Mostly those cases are preserved from the original.

== nulls ==

I'm not sure about that word. First "nulla" would be female as numbers are mostly female. Second I would rather say it is "sifra, str. f." as it was in other languages like in Old Norse. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 19:01, 28 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
