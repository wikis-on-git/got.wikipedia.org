:Yeah, that's the big problem. Translatewiki closed the translation function for the Gothic Wikipedia.

==maurgwaurdus==
First of all this would be "maurgu-" because maurgus is u-stem. And second, I don't agree with this form. There is no word like "waurdus" which is masculine, the real word is "waurd" or "waurdi". But both wouldn't fit quite well. In the sense of "text" one should better use "bokos". And the sense "short+text" wouldn't match the semantical sense of "summary". Without laying the focus on German I would recommend something equivalent to "Inhaltsangabe": "innahalda-angaba".

==wreitmahteig==
Even if "wreit" seems to be cognate to the English word it wouldn't be a good word here. It has the meaning of carving and I don't think that a printer is still carving into the paper.

What do you mean by navigation? The navigation on a website or the navigation with the device in the car? I think "gawiss" is not a good word for that.

:And how do you come to "-w-ei"?? That ending is only traditional to one word "agg-w-ei". And even there the "-w-" doesn't even belong to the ending itself.

     I wouldn't use feila, since files and data are different. bandwjan means reveal information, which is close to datum/data.

:With feil you are right. I don't like it either. But bandwjan doesn't mean exactly to reveal an information as we need it, it means rather "to give a hint" "to reveal a sign/mystical". What about dividing it into two senses: feil (or another better word) for computer files as what it means and for other things we could use "wairth" what data would mean in that context.

:Why do you eliminate the fricative /h/? I think it should stay in that word since it was in the arabic word and the Goths could have only copied the word in earlier times and then there still was that fricative. Furthermore can't it be a "-i" declension as for that the criterias are: long vowel/diphthongue, short vowel + 2 consonants or more than one syllable. This is not true for this word. So the "-i" declension can't be applied here. I would still say it is just "kahwa". The arabic word had an "-a" at the end and was female, why should the Goths change this when it fits so perfectly to their declension? Mostly those cases are preserved from the original.

:Knot would be: [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]hnots, str. m.; the verb to know would be: [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]hnotjan, -jan. I'm adding it to the list. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 15:52, 12 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

==Category==

We need a word for category. [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 22:20, 16 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

kategori, st. f. ? [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 22:22, 16 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:First, it's true, that we need a word. Second, kategori would really not be the best choice then. 3. We have the problem, that the translation function for our wikipedia is closed. So we cannot change the word in the programming language. Maybe we could take "galisei" "collection" or "gatassei" "ordered things".

:: I'd go with ordered things. Galisei would be better for "gallery" or something like that, I think. [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 01:54, 18 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
:::The Icelandic word is "flokk", which also translates as group. All the other Germanic languages seem to just use a version of the word category. [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 17:30, 19 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
::::I just remembered! I've been using hansa for category on Wt/got/ (gothic wiktionary). So that would be great cuz it means group. [[User:Bleakgh|Bleakgh]] ([[User talk:Bleakgh|talk]]) 20:16, 20 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

:::::I guess that would work for so far. I'm not totally fine with it, but maybe that is a personal thing. I also remember now that I have already been reading this here. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 23:10, 25 𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌼𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)
