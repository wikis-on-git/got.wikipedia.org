:Yeah, that's the big problem. Translatewiki closed the translation function for the Gothic Wikipedia. They said that we have to write in Gothic letters but the users translating the wikipedia back then used latin letters. I really prefer Gothic letters as this is traditional.

==maurgwaurdus==
First of all this would be "maurgu-" because maurgus is u-stem. And second, I don't agree with this form. There is no word like "waurdus" which is masculine, the real word is "waurd" or "waurdi". But both wouldn't fit quite well. In the sense of "text" one should better use "bokos". And the sense "short+text" wouldn't match the semantical sense of "summary". Without laying the focus on German I would recommend something equivalent to "Inhaltsangabe": "innahalda-angaba".

==wreitmahteig==
Even if "wreit" seems to be cognate to the English word it wouldn't be a good word here. It has the meaning of carving and I don't think that a printer is still carving into the paper. The word for "write" is "meljan". But I like the ending "mahteigs", so I would say: meljamahteigs. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

What do you mean by navigation? The navigation on a website or the navigation with the device in the car? I think "gawiss" is not a good word for that.

:And how do you come to "-w-ei"?? That ending is only traditional to one word "agg-w-ei". And even there the "-w-" doesn't even belong to the ending itself.

According to the most grammaticarians "ei" was pronounced "î". But the use of "ei" has etymological reasons. "lista" is a loanword and would not get an "ei" for long "î". It would just be "lista". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 16:55, 26 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     I wouldn't use feila, since files and data are different. bandwjan means reveal information, which is close to datum/data.

:With feil you are right. I don't like it either. But bandwjan doesn't mean exactly to reveal an information as we need it, it means rather "to give a hint" "to reveal a sign/mystical". What about dividing it into two senses: feil (or another better word) for computer files as what it means and for other things we could use "wairth" what data would mean in that context. "wairthbairgo" would then be a collection of data in the sense of values. [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 17:35, 30 𐌲𐍂𐌰𐍃𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

     kafes was already there as an irregular noun meaning coffee.

:Why do you eliminate the fricative /h/? I think it should stay in that word since it was in the arabic word and the Goths could have only copied the word in earlier times and then there still was that fricative. Furthermore can't it be a "-i" declension as for that the criterias are: long vowel/diphthongue, short vowel + 2 consonants or more than one syllable. This is not true for this word. So the "-i" declension can't be applied here. I would still say it is just "kahwa". The arabic word had an "-a" at the end and was female, why should the Goths change this when it fits so perfectly to their declension? Mostly those cases are preserved from the original.

I don't know if this has an impact to the correctness of the derivation of the Gothic word, but the German word "her" has two meanings: "ago" and "to here"; and in the word "herunterladen" it is used in the second meaning: "her-unter-laden" means "load down to-here".

== Some new word proposals ==

Ok, as I can't edit this page and I need to translate a website in Gothic, I will do some word proposals here for words which I simply can't find here but which need a word in Gothic. I will edit this part if I find new words, I just want to hear if there are better proposals here. If there aren't, I will simply use these words. I will also explain why I use all these words.

*translation - in-meideins (this simply is the word 'change' in Gothic, which is some kind of translation of 'translation') The etymological origin of Latin however is:  "a carrying across, removal, transporting; transfer of meaning,"
:::There is already a word for 'to translate': 'gaskeirjan'. We can tighten the meaning to the extension of 'to translate'. 
::::I wrote this when I wasn't that good in Gothic yet. I always use 'skeirjan' for 'to translate' because the dictionaries give that meaning.

So if you prefer another word, I can fully agree on this, as I have the feeling that in-meideins isn't the best translation.
*button - hriggs (this is the word 'ring' in Gothic, if an old Goth would have lived in these days and saw a button on a computer screen, I think the most likely word he would use was 'circle', so maybe hriggs isn't such a bad word for a button, as we don't know what button was in Gothic.)
:::I guess I would go with the other languages that almost always use the allegory to the look of a 'button/knob'. So I'd suggest 'knuppa' mn.

::::::The problem is that knuppa is not attested, while hrigga is in fact attested, aren't we safer to use a word which the Goths definitely knew instead of a word which is a reconstruction while you have an alternative? A button in fact looks like a ring, so it isn't that much of a strange choice. Although, only some buttons are a circle. Can we also use hriggs for buttons in the form of a circle and for the others knuppa?

*philosophy - þagki (the noun of the verb 'waurdjan' (to talk) is 'waurdi' (talking), the verb of to think is 'þagkjan' and however we can do the same with the word economy and have a direct borrowing, I think it's better if we, just like in Icelandic, try to create original words when it's possible.)
:::If you'd derive 'philosophy' from 'þagkjan' I'd suggest something like 'þagkeins' fu. But even that would cover the meaning of 'philosophy'. I would go with the Greek word here: 'filosofia' fa. (Philosophy is the 'science of thinking' or 'the thinking about thinking'. To name it only 'thinking' would cover the meaning.) I would do the same with 'aikonomja' fa.

*policy - runa (which is the word 'plan' in Gothic, as in 'Gods plan'. A policy is something which the gouvernment or an organization wants to happen, just like Gods intentions to let certain things happen, so the word 'runa' might be the most appropriate word here. The word is used here: 
"the teachers of the law rejected God's plan for them" witodafasteis fraqethun runa gudis ana sik.
:::Don't you think that 'runa' is far too unspecialised for that meaning? It doesn't cover the meaning of 'policy' or describes it any further. It must be a word that really denotes what it means. As it is borrowed from Latin/Greek in almost every language I would go with 'politeia' fa. 

*gender - kuni (same word as family, in German we use Geschlecht and in Dutch geslacht, which etymological origin can be found here, my source is the etymological dictionary:

c.1300, "kind, sort, class," from Old French gendre (12c., Modern French genre), from stem of Latin genus (genitive generis) "race, stock, family; kind, rank, order; species," also (male or female) "sex" (see genus) and used to translate Aristotle's Greek grammatical term genos. 

So, the same word as family seems legit to me.
:::'kuni' has rather the meaning of 'tribe' or 'race'. I would go with Germanic cognates for which 'kunja' mn. was reconstructed. 

*administrator - ragineis (We have a lot of choice here, ragineis might be the best word as it means both a ruler and a councellor, a councellor was someone who ruled a city. Ruling a city means also maintaining policies and such and not just ruling without having obligations)
:::I would rather use a word that comes from 'andbahti' for that has the meaning of 'administration'. So, maybe 'andbahts' ma.

Based on the verb 'to register' which is:

ana-meljan, as 'ana' is a preposition which means 'in' here, I thought that it would be logical to take the verb 'out', which is 'us', for unregister.

Compare it to Dutch: uitschrijven, this word is used as a negation of 'inschrijven', inschrijven means 'to register' and 'uitschrijven' mean to unregister, so it's used if you don't want to be a part of a municipality anymore.

==To click==

I recommend the following neologism and old Gothic word: kramjan
kramjan means 'to press' in Gothic, and not 'to press on a person', for which you also find a lot of translations.
My other neologism is 'klikjan'. As Dutch, English and German have equivalents of this word too. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 21:31, 4 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:I would go for 'kramjan', for 'click' is onomatopoeic for the sound of 'clicking'. In German and Dutch is more an anglicism than a cognate. But on the other hand I am not quite sure about its semantics. The only translation says 'to press', right. But I guess it is rather meant as 'to seize', 'to scratch' or 'to cram' (same word btw).

I recommend something like, and correct me as I don't know how to combine words:  midjis-austra. Midja-austra. I don't know how to write it. fauraasia looks rather strange to me and I don't know this in any other Germanic language, it isn't used in Dutch, not in English, not in Scandinavian languages, only in German so why would you use it in Gothic then if it is not a shared word in all Germanic languages?

:::I didn't say they borrowed it from German. I just used it as an example because 'faura-' is quite productive in Gothic. Gothic doesn't always have to take the quintessence from all Germanic languages and only those forms that are attested in most Germanic languages. But as I said, something with 'middle' is fine with me. The problem is just that in every language the borders between the different Asia regions are quite different and not distinct. So we have to take the same blurry definitions like in English or elsewhere.

::::If that's the case we don't know it anymore. I think that it's best if we choose the Middle East in Gothic, because what we are doing here is designing a modern Gothic. It needs to be an accessible language and if we make up new words which are completely different from other languages, you rather discourage people from learning modern Gothic than motivating them. I got to idea to maybe create a website to learn Gothic in the future, but I will wait until we have some standard forms for words etc. I discourage 'fauraasia' because not only Germanic but also Romanic languages use an equivalent of middle east, like French "le moyen-orient", therefore a rendering of middle east would not only be accessible for a lot of people, but simply also the most likely. I have another question, could you change Peru in just the word we already designed, I believe it was Pairu, now it says Igkaland and no one uses it or wants to use it, so that makes it a useless word.

And is it really useful to remove it as 'sanda' basically gives the meaning of a sent message between two persons. But as for facebook messages etc. I agree with you that 'mereins' is a good word, as 'merjan' originally ment something like: to spread a message, to announce. And that is basically what you do. If we use mereins for personal messages too it can get confusing as you aren't spreading a message among a lot of people, but just with one person.

All I am trying to say is that we cannot reanalyse words with other meanings because they are just sooomehow in a neighboured semantic field. Of course, in general, it is better to stick to attested words. But in this case we don't have a real word for 'message' in the abstract sense. So, we shouldn't try to find an attested word and force it into this semantics for all one is worth. If you reeeeally want to take 'sanda', go for it. I can't forbid you to take or use it. ;) But epistaule is the word for 'letter' in Gothic, which should stay that way. It sometimes happens that an old word gets reanalysed to another meaning. So, a 'message' and a 'shipment' would be polyphones in Gothic then. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 09:53, 26 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

:I recommend to not do that. German word uses are often restricted to German and the worst you can do. Try to find universal Germanic uses of words, that's why I always do. Or try to have a direct rendering of Latin. Could you add  international = miththiudisks  to your dictionary? I use this as it's a direct rendering of   'international' = inter (between) national (nations), miththiudisks basically has the same meaning.

I use it at my news website etc. so I recommend to insert it, as if you don't insert it, we will have different word uses in different places.

The neologism for phone is:  faírrahausjands  / faírrarodjands

mobile in the sense of mobile phone, could be based on the Gothic root for to move, movable.

Wigeinisks faírrahausjands  =   movable far-hearing.

=="Gothic horror"==
The ancient Goths have no direct relation to the modern literary genre of "Gothic fiction". The link is a very confusing deal: "Goth" came to mean anything barbarian or Germanic, and basically was applied to architecture and art that developed in the Holy Roman Empire and France. These people were rivals of the Goths, so it wouldn't make sense that the Goths would have used their name for what was devised by their enemies, and was also considered by everyone all around them to be barbarian. They would have distanced themselves form these art forms for these reasons, and perhaps would have called it "barbarisks" or "fragkisks". Then, it came to mean anything mysterious or romantic/wistful, and, by that extension, the literary genre that takes place in Gothic buildings and features wistful and mysterious ("Gothic") elements. The Goths, by now, would not have even used the word "gutisks" for this kind of thing, since they always called the architecture something else. Also, their own people weren't very mysterious to them, as they knew their culture and suchlike. This is assuming that they had survived into the present day. So, the literary genre would have never been, in the Gothic language, known as "Gothic". I'm thinking that, for the art form, we use one of my suggestions above, and, for the genre, perhaps we could do what German does: they call it "Schauerliteratur", which would be, in Gothic, "skūra[literature]". The French also have a name for "Gothic novels": romans noirs. We could also borrow "noir" into Gothic as "nwar". It means "black literature", and I think it makes more sense to use German or French as our basis--lots of this literature comes from those languages, and they are big countries in literature anyhow. Also, for the "Goth subculture", we might want to use something else, too, simply to avoid confusion. I can't think of anything, though, so I need others to help me with this. --[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 17:01, 23 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

If you use swarts to mean the subculture, and you call yourself a goth in Gothic, "I am a goth" (Goth. Ik im swartan) literally "I am a black" don't you think that's a little racist?

I understand that lots of people have used their own ideas in their personal writing, but, as a community, we need to agree on words.

The word "kuni" has been used for "gender", but it also means "kind", "type", etc., which could be confusing. Could there be a more specific word, perhaps based on "kuni"? Also, Gothic is lacking in gender-related terms, such as "trnsgender", "genderqueer", etc. I propose 'transkuni' for transgender, or "diakuni". "Genderqueer" might be harder Any suggestions?

In Gothic, we could use qinomanna "woman-man", isfráujo "he-lady", ufarkuni "transgender". Though I have no clue about queer, I have derived Gothic word for gay and a gay person, but not really the vulgar term queer. The Anglish words for "to cross" is thwarse and stride over.  For LGBT terms, I have skular "a gay man" (from German schwul), lesbisks (lesbian) (Germ. lesbisch, Swed. and Dan. lesbisk) [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Moonspell Bloodlines|Moonspell the Goth (Mēnasáiþjis Gutan)]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Moonspell Bloodlines|talk]]) 18:32, 6 𐍆𐍂𐌿𐌼𐌰 𐌾𐌹𐌿𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃 2014 (UTC)
::You cannot borrow words from modern Germanic languages without looking at the history of that respective word. The German word 'schwul' derived from Low Saxon 'schwul' meaning 'oppressive hot'. German also adopted that meaning, too, by changing it to 'schwül' in analogy to 'kühl'. Thus, It cannot be used to derive a Gothic word for 'queer'. But I really like this discussion and I am looking forward to other ideas. Albeit the 'concept' of homosexuality has been relatively unknown or marginal to Goths. I guess they didn't even have a word for it or used christian terminology. It has been very likely a taboo subject that nobody spoke about, thus, no real words for it, probably only paraphrases like 'having intercourse with the same sexe'. But I agree that we should find a neutral way of saying this since modern Goths of nowadays also have to overcome (religious) prejudices and face normal biology. ;) [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 20:56, 6 𐍆𐍂𐌿𐌼𐌰 𐌾𐌹𐌿𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃 2014 (UTC)

:::::Yes, homosexuals don't hurt others with their feelings so it's good that it's considered normal, that's why I don't have personal problems with it. As for genetics, it depends on what you consider normal. Even if it is abnormal, it should be accepted as people didn't choose to become homosexual and like I said, they don't hurt anyone. There are problems with a lot of groups regarding this however. Autistic people for example still aren't accepted completely while they can't really help it how they are, it's good that some first steps are made with some groups, including homosexuals. I 'm not really sure about transgenders though, it could have a very big negative impact on your life to change your gender.

:::::::The change of your gender when you are transsexual is not something you just came up with recently. It is based upon a disorder of your sexual identity. The changing is not a expression of creativity to get a new look but rather an adaption to your real sexual identity, for it didn't match your outer look before. Of course it is a big impact on your life, but for most of them it is fore and allmost a relief. And homosexuality is not to be regarded as 'acceptable' because they don't hurt anyone or despite it could be genetically abnormal. Sexuality has many ways to express, heterosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, homosexuality etc. All of them are normal expressions of sexuality, not one of them worse or better then the others, they just differ in frequency. And homosexuality has by the way its evolutionary purposes. Sorry for this off-topic excourse, just wanted to make sure. ;) The discussion is still open for further suggestions for 'transgender', 'gay', 'queer', 'lesbian' and other words for 'homosexuality'.

I wouldn't quite enjoy using "she-man", "woman-man", and "man-woman". Transwomen, for example (burn as males but identify as women) are not "man-women", but just women. They're not "she-men" either. This is why "transkuni" or "trnsahmakuni" would be best. For "gender", why not something like "soul-kind" be better, since it describes the identity of your soul? (Also, anything suggesting "half" or "two" is out of the question, as there are more than two genders anyways.) I propose "ahmakuni". "Genderqueer" and "non-binary" could be described with "unbeinareis" or something? I don't mind borrowings here, since, unless we want a big clunky word, they'd help a lot. "Homosexual" could be "galeikaseksuals" or "haumoseksuals" (''every'' other language in Europe uses something ike this except Greek, whose "kinaidos" could become "kinaidus" in Gothic, but it might mean something else anyway), "bisexual" could be "twáiseksuals", "pansexual" could be "allaseksuals", "asexual" could be "unseksuals", "heterosexual" could be "aljaseksuals", etc. "Qinomanna" could be "androgyne" or the like, as well as, perhaps, "twisks" (adj. and noun). As I've mentioned, "neutrois" could be "niutraújs" (neuter a-stem; the "-s" does not go away), or "spad" from Latin "spado" (eunuch, but repurposed). It would be a neuter a-stem. "Genderfluid" could be "ahmakuni-flōbēreis". "Aliagender" could be "alja-ahmakuni". The neuter gender of adjectives could describe those of us who are outside the gender binary.

::I'd go for 'transkuni'. 'transahma' sounds too spiritual to me for a medical/psychological term to me. By 'soul-kind' for 'gender' do you only mean the use of 'gender' in a modern emancipation process or 'gender' in general? I guess 'kuni' is short and concise. And gender is not only psychological or in the soul of someone, gender also manifests in the morphotype, the body, the chromosomes etc. (Of course in way more forms than only two.) Maybe it would be too spritual, too. 'unbeinareis' is fine for me. 'galeikaseksuals' and 'homoseksuals' could be synonyms. (I would go with 'homo-' rather than with 'haumo-' for both 'o's are long.) For 'bisexual' I'd rather say 'biseksuals' for most of the world's languages, even the Germanic ones, use that prefix. I would proceed with most of the other words like 'panseksuals', 'aseksuals' (There might be semantic difference between 'unseksuals' and 'aseksuals'.), heteroseksuals ([sic!] for it is a long 'e' and not a short one.) etc. The question is do we need a shorter word for heterosexual like 'straight' in English? Not every language has it. We could say 'heteros' for males and 'hetera' for women (like its Old Greek counterpart) as many languages just use that short form. I wouldn't take 'niutraujs' for 'neutrois' since 'neutrois' is an English invention and we could or should either take it is that 'neutrois' or use the other terms for it like 'kunilaus' or 'unkuni'/'akuni'.

:::Well, "kuni" can mean any type of class, such as gender, species, nationality, etc., but "ahmakuni" is the only one that describes, basically, the "kind" or "class" of your soul, which basically encompasses all of your feelings and personality. "Kuni" on its own does not denote this in particular (and, with new Tumblr identities and all that jazz, there can be multiple interpretations of the word "transkuni", such as "transspecies" and "transethnicity", so "transkuni" isn't specific enough). I'd advocate for something like "ahmakuni" in all Germanic languages, actually, since it makes more sense than just "kind" or "type". (The soul identities involved in otherkin and therianthropy can be called "saíwalakuni/saíwlakuni" since it refers to the identity of the whole soul.) "Straight" could be "heterus" (masc. a-stem) and "hetera" (fem. o-stem), like other languages. I think it's okay to borrow "neutrois", since publications in Japanese, German, Spanish, etc. that I've seen just use a form of it. It's quite different from "non-gendered", since it's neutral, but that ''is'' the identity of a neutrois person. We have gender, just it happens to be neutral, almost between "agender" and "aliagender". That's at least my understanding. Either "niutraújs" or "spad" (neut. a-stem) could work; maybe that second one can mean neutral-gender in all its forms: neutrois, agender, and genderless, perhaps. They're still very close to each other. "Niut" can be a short "slang term" if you will. "Neutrois" in that form does not conform to Gothic phonology enough, either way.And, I think that, if everyone is okay with using the Greek prefixes for "homosexual", "bisexual", etc., then it's a go. --[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 19:49, 9 𐍆𐍂𐌿𐌼𐌰 𐌾𐌹𐌿𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃 2014 (UTC)

==Colours==
Warning: I wrote another essay below! <br>"Colourful" is attested as fáihs, so "colour" should be "fáih", neuter a-stem. Now, as for colour words, "red", "black", "white", and "purple" are attested. I've seen "gēlws" for yellow, and "grōneis" for green (why -eis, though?). I’ve also seen "blēws" used for blue. As for "indigo", the word in Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic is "anil" (Pt.), "añil" (Sp.), and "an-nīl" (Arabic). This would most likely become Gothic "aneils". It’s the best idea, in my opinion, since all the languages that surround(ed) the Goths used this word. For "orange coloured", I think either "gēlwaráuþs" (yellow-red) or "fōngēlws" (fire-yellow) would be good. I use "fúnguls" for Vandalic, by the way, so just saying. Of course, the option of something based on "orange/narancio" is also available.

:I would use 'farwa' for colour, since that is attested in Gothic and cognate to almost all Germanic languages. 'fáihs' means rather German 'bunt'. In English you might think to much of the notion of 'colour' because the word 'colourful' contains it. I am fine with the rest except that I would rather use a derivation of 'orange' as in other languages, 'yellow-red' seems a bit too forced to me.

::In my translation of Alice in Wonderland I needed to translate 'orange' and 'marmelade'. I translated marmelade as: marmalada, and orange as: "oraggs", in which the dative which I had to use was: "oragga". As orange in languages like German and Dutch and other languages often uses a long vowel instead of a short one, I recommend the use of "o" instead of "au". Is this a good alternative for orange?

:::(I changed the beginning message to this section, since it looked better.) Where is "farwa" attested? I couldn't find a word for "colour" anywhere. "Oraggs" would be good for sometihng relating to the orange fruit (which is what "orange marmalade" is talking about, and not the colour), but the colour could perhaps use a different word. In Swedish, I see they use "brandgul" alongside "orange", so why not the same with Gothic? We could have "gēlwaráuþs" and "oraggs". I'd like that, perhaps. (Also, "orange" in "orange marmalade" should be an adjective, right?) But is "aneils" good? And, why do all the ja-stem adjectives end in -eis, when they should end in -jis? I'm asking on behalf of "grōneis". --[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 19:57, 9 𐍆𐍂𐌿𐌼𐌰 𐌾𐌹𐌿𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:::As it turns out, "farwa" means "form, shape, external appearance", and not "colour". I'm willing to revisit "fáih", unless anyone else wants to use "kolorus" or "lits", through analogy with Old Norse "litr". Or, of course, anytihng else. --[[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Shikku27316|talk]]) 20:58, 9 𐍆𐍂𐌿𐌼𐌰 𐌾𐌹𐌿𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃 2014 (UTC)

::::Sorry, but I would still advocate for 'farwa'. Köbler translates it as 'Farbe' and it is the same word that is used by many Germanic languages, if not all in earlier stages. Sure, the semantical extension then was broader than today, also including the notion of 'form' and 'shape'. But still, we have a Gothic word with it for colour, even if it has synonyms. 'Farwa' goes back to Germanic 'colourful'. 21:19, 9 𐍆𐍂𐌿𐌼𐌰 𐌾𐌹𐌿𐌻𐌴𐌹𐍃 2014 (UTC)

==centipede and millipede==
For centipede I derived '''hunda-fotus''' (hunred-foot, as the Latin centi- (hundred) and -pes (foot) and '''hunda-lagjis''' (hundred-leg) for centipede (I recently watched Human Centipede: The First Sequence and Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence and wanted a Gothic equivalent to it's Dutch and German sisters), similar to German Hundertfüßer (hundred-footer) and Dutch duizendpoot (thousand-leg). For millipede I have '''þūsundi-lagjis''' and '''þūsundi-fotus'''.

==New word for comment==

Currently I find biquths, without any stem and without a gender, which makes the word useless if you want to use it, as the stem and gender are unkown.
I don't know if it's correct though and I made these observations:
This word, it means, to notice, to observe, to take notice of, the problem is that I 'm not sure if "perceive" and "notice" also apply well to this word, because perceiving something and noticing something is basically what a comment is. But it is mostly an opinion. 
gaumjan 16, gau-m-jan,  sw. V. (1), m. Dat., perfektiv: nhd. bemerken, erscheinen (= Pass.), seine Aufmerksamkeit auf etwas richten; ne. attend to, pay attention to, take care of, see to, perceive, notice (V.), take notice of, observe.
Maybe gaumeins or gaumi?
Could we possibly use "mitons" which means "opinion"? Or is that not a good solution? I need to know, as I come across the word "comment" a lot in my translations.

:Most languages just use something based on Latin "commentum", why not "þata kaúmaínto" (on-stem)?
