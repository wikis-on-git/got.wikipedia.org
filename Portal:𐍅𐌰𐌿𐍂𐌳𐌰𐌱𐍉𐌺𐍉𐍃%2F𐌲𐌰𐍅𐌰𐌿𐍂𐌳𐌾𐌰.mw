:Yeah, that's the big problem. Translatewiki closed the translation function for the Gothic Wikipedia.

==maurgwaurdus==
First of all this would be "maurgu-" because maurgus is u-stem. And second, I don't agree with this form. There is no word like "waurdus" which is masculine, the real word is "waurd" or "waurdi". But both wouldn't fit quite well. In the sense of "text" one should better use "bokos". And the sense "short+text" wouldn't match the semantical sense of "summary". Without laying the focus on German I would recommend something equivalent to "Inhaltsangabe": "innahalda-angaba".

==wreitmahteig==
Even if "wreit" seems to be cognate to the English word it wouldn't be a good word here. It has the meaning of carving and I don't think that a printer is still carving into the paper.

What do you mean by navigation? The navigation on a website or the navigation with the device in the car? I think "gawiss" is not a good word for that.

:And how do you come to "-w-ei"?? That ending is only traditional to one word "agg-w-ei". And even there the "-w-" doesn't even belong to the ending itself.

:With feil you are right. I don't like it either. But bandwjan doesn't mean exactly to reveal an information as we need it, it means rather "to give a hint" "to reveal a sign/mystical". What about dividing it into two senses: feil (or another better word) for computer files as what it means and for other things we could use "wairth" what data would mean in that context.

:Why do you eliminate the fricative /h/? I think it should stay in that word since it was in the arabic word and the Goths could have only copied the word in earlier times and then there still was that fricative. Furthermore can't it be a "-i" declension as for that the criterias are: long vowel/diphthongue, short vowel + 2 consonants or more than one syllable. This is not true for this word. So the "-i" declension can't be applied here. I would still say it is just "kahwa". The arabic word had an "-a" at the end and was female, why should the Goths change this when it fits so perfectly to their declension? Mostly those cases are preserved from the original.

:Please always search the niuja waurda list first before you post new words.
:We already have words for computer - garahnja, keyboard - bokabaurd, paper - papeirus. 
:The word "abaka" wouldn't have existed. It never was female, in no language. 
:[[File:agree.png|15px|link]] It would be "abakus" and masculine. I would say it's ''abakus, m. (u-decl.)''.
:For "paper clip" I wouldn't use "-binda" since this would mean something like a "string" which is wraped around a paper. 
:Besides, I don't know why you divide between "staple" and "paper clip". 
:[[File:agree.png|15px|link]] For both "papeirukrampa, weak m." would fit.

:Well, since "skald" (poet) seems to be pretty common to germanic languages and it is attested for Old Norse I would say it's [[File:agree.png|15px|link]]"skald, str. n." in Gothic. 
:For poetry I am not sure yet what to take. There must have been an own word for it. I guess it was something like "liuþ" even if it means the same as "song". [[User:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[User talk:Zylbath|talk]]) 19:06, 19 𐌱𐌻𐍉𐌼𐌰𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

it could be liuthskap or something like that (song + ship = songship)

::Please always subscribe with <pre>~~~~</pre>. I don't think that the ending was that productive then and it wouldn't have the meaning to make a compound with "liuþ".

:"nati" is already the word for internet, you can look it up in the list of the gothic mailing list. (By the way it is not fatal that it has just the meaning of "net". In Germany we often say just say "Netz", too.) And as an equivalent to "web+site" we have "internet+place" = "natistaþs".

When I need to write the word culture in Gothic, I just use the same word for society, that is what culture basically is.

== verschiedentlich (on various occasions) ==
In German there is this word "verschiedentlich" which means something like "in different ways". In Gothic there is a word called: "analeiko" which means "in the same way". We could then make a word up that means the difference: "anamisso". What do you think? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Zylbath]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 20:14, 10 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2012 (UTC)

I don't know if this has an impact to the correctness of the derivation of the Gothic word, but the German word "her" has two meanings: "ago" and "to here"; and in the word "herunterladen" it is used in the second meaning: "her-unter-laden" means "load down to-here".

== Some new word proposals ==

Ok, as I can't edit this page and I need to translate a website in Gothic, I will do some word proposals here for words which I simply can't find here but which need a word in Gothic. I will edit this part if I find new words, I just want to hear if there are better proposals here. If there aren't, I will simply use these words. I will also explain why I use all these words.

*translation - in-meideins (this simply is the word 'change' in Gothic, which is some kind of translation of 'translation') The etymological origin of Latin however is:  "a carrying across, removal, transporting; transfer of meaning,"

So if you prefer another word, I can fully agree on this, as I have the feeling that in-meideins isn't the best translation.
*button - hriggs (this is the word 'ring' in Gothic, if an old Goth would have lived in these days and saw a button on a computer screen, I think the most likely word he would use was 'circle', so maybe hriggs isn't such a bad word for a button, as we don't know what button was in Gothic.)
*philosophy - þagki (the noun of the verb 'waurdjan' (to talk) is 'waurdi' (talking), the verb of to think is 'þagkjan' and however we can do the same with the word economy and have a direct borrowing, I think it's better if we, just like in Icelandic, try to create original words when it's possible.)
*policy - runa (which is the word 'plan' in Gothic, as in 'Gods plan'. A policy is something which the gouvernment or an organization wants to happen, just like Gods intentions to let certain things happen, so the word 'runa' might be the most appropriate word here. The word is used here: 
"the teachers of the law rejected God's plan for them" witodafasteis fraqethun runa gudis ana sik.
*gender - kuni (same word as family, in German we use Geschlecht and in Dutch geslacht, which etymological origin can be found here, my source is the etymological dictionary:

c.1300, "kind, sort, class," from Old French gendre (12c., Modern French genre), from stem of Latin genus (genitive generis) "race, stock, family; kind, rank, order; species," also (male or female) "sex" (see genus) and used to translate Aristotle's Greek grammatical term genos. 

So, the same word as family seems legit to me.
*administrator - ragineis (We have a lot of choice here, ragineis might be the best word as it means both a ruler and a councellor, a councellor was someone who ruled a city. Ruling a city means also maintaining policies and such and not just ruling without having obligations)

I have translated 'unregister' as:

*us-meljan

Based on the verb 'to register' which is:

ana-meljan, as 'ana' is a preposition which means 'in' here, I thought that it would be logical to take the verb 'out', which is 'us', for unregister.

Compare it to Dutch: uitschrijven, this word is used as a negation of 'inschrijven', inschrijven means 'to register' and 'uitschrijven' mean to unregister, so it's used if you don't want to be a part of a municipality anymore.

==To click==

I recommend the following neologism and old Gothic word: kramjan
kramjan means 'to press' in Gothic, and not 'to press on a person', for which you also find a lot of translations.
My other neologism is 'klikjan'. As Dutch, English and German have equivalents of this word too. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Bokareis|Bokareis]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Bokareis|talk]]) 21:31, 4 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:I would go for 'kramjan', for 'click' is onomatopoeic for the sound of 'clicking'. In German and Dutch is more an anglicism than a cognate. But on the other hand I am not quite sure about its semantics. The only translation says 'to press', right. But I guess it is rather meant as 'to seize', 'to scratch' or 'to cram' (same word btw). I guess I said somewhere once something about '𐌸𐍂𐌹𐌿𐌺𐌾𐌰𐌽', as reconstructed from ger. 'drücken' or nl. 'drukken'. But I am not quite sure whether that is also the best choice.

==Middle East==
What would you say about 'fauraasia' for Middle East? Cognate to 'Vorderasien' in German. But I would be fine with a construction with 'middle' in Gothic, too. Any suggestions? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 21:34, 9 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

==Unattested==
I have chosen the word 'unweitwodiþs' for that, coming from 'weitwôdjan' - to attest. What do you think? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 22:31, 9 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

==Message==
What word would you use for 'message'? I would say 'mêreins' for it. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 11:07, 14 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)

== Item ==
I would use something like 'alone standing' --> 'ainakls' and 'link' (part of a chain/mass) --> *hlenks ----> ainaklahlenks, st. m. (In Low Saxon: Enkellenk, in German: Einzelglied) Or would you use an anglizism like 'aitem' st. n.?

== Information ==
I would use 'uskunþi' -ja n. cognate to German 'Auskunft'. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 12:19, 14 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:There is already a neologism for information. David Conolly has made a list with neologisms which someone else bundled for me in a PDF file. He came up with 'infaúrmatsjon', in fact ALL languages use the word information in their own spelling so why would we not do this with Gothic? That's rather unnatural.

I will send you the list later but I 'm using this neologism for all things I do know and if you are going to change the word for information I will simply not use it and continue with this neologism.

== to print ==
I would use 'þrukan'/'þrukjan' for printing. It is cognate to the Germanic languages and '*þruks' is already reconstructed as ger. 'Druck' in Gothic. [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 12:34, 14 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:As we already use 'kaúrjan' for 'to click' I think this isn't too bad. In order to prevent confusion it can be used. But in Dutch we have for example: 'afdrukken' when we print something. In German I believe 'abdrücken' (not sure), if it's a good idea, try to find a good alternative in which you also insert the af / ab-  preposition.

I would suggest something cognate to German 'handlich', so --> 'handwaleiks' maybe? [[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍃:Zylbath|Kevin Behrens]] ([[𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽𐌳𐌹𐍃 𐌲𐌰𐍅𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌾𐌰:Zylbath|talk]]) 13:53, 14 𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌽𐌼𐌴𐌽𐍉𐌸𐍃 2014 (UTC)
:I recommend to not do that. German word uses are often restricted to German and the worst you can do. Try to find universal Germanic uses of words, that's why I always do. Or try to have a direct rendering of Latin. Could you add  international = miththiudisks  to your dictionary? I use this as it's a direct rendering of   'international' = inter (between) national (nations), miththiudisks basically has the same meaning.

I use it at my news website etc. so I recommend to insert it, as if you don't insert it, we will have different word uses in different places.

The neologism for phone is:  faírrahausjands  / faírrarodjands

mobile in the sense of mobile phone, could be based on the Gothic root for to move, movable.

Wigeinisks faírrahausjands  =   movable far-hearing.
